As a research scientist at **St. Jude**, I develop <u>machine learning</u> applications in <u>cancer</u> and <u>genomics</u> researches (single-cell sequencing, spatial genomics, and multi-omics). 

Before joining St. Jude, I led research projects on <u>evolution</u> and <u>population genetics</u> at the **University of Texas, Austin**.  I studied <u>infectious diseases</u> and genomics at **Notre Dame**, and I did statistical modeling at **UCLA**.
