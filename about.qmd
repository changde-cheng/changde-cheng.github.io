<!-- As a research scientist at St. Jude, I develop machine learning applications in cancer and genomics researches (single-cell sequencing, spatial genomics, and multi-omics).  -->

<!-- Before joining St. Jude, I led research projects on evolution and population genetics at the University of Texas, Austin.  I studied infectious diseases and genomics at Notre Dame, and I did statistical modeling at UCLA.  -->
