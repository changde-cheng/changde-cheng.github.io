Menin inhibitors that disrupt Menin-MLL interaction hold promise for treating specific acute myeloid leukemia subtypes, yet resistance remains a challenge. Here, we uncover a resistance mechanism independent of canonical Menin-MLL targets. We show that a group of non-canonical Menin targets co-occupied by the repressive H2AK119ub, are also repressed by Menin inhibition. The loss of Polycomb Repressive Complex 1.1 (PRC1.1) leads to reduced H2AK119ub repression and reactivation of these non-canonical targets in resistance cells. Importantly, we show that these targets, including MYC, play a key role in driving Menin inhibitor resistance. Moreover, we demonstrate that leukemia cells deficient in PRC1.1 exhibit reduced monocytic gene signatures and are susceptible to the BCL2 inhibition, and combinational treatment of venetoclax overcomes the therapeutic resistance to Menin inhibition. These findings highlight that epigenetic reactivation of non-canonical Menin-MLL targets could drive Menin therapeutic resistance and provide new strategies to counter this resistance.
