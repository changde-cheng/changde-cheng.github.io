# About me
During my postdoc, I worked with Mark Kirkpatrick and David Houle, studying sexual antagonistic selection, the evolution of sexual differentiation, and aging. \
Prior to that, I completed my Ph.D. at the University of Notre Dame, under the guidance of Nora Besansky, where I researched speciation, chromosomal evolution, ecological genomics, and evolutionary genomics. \
Before pursuing my Ph.D., I worked with Charles Taylor at UCLA on evolutionary genetics, even though I was more interested in artificial life. \
I earned my B.S. degree in cell biology and genetics from Peking University.

#### Therapy Design and Engineering 

<!-- ::: {.callout-note collapse="false" appearance="minimal" style="background-color: #FF69B4; border-color: gray; color: white;"} -->
We design and engineer combination therapies by mapping epistasis, inferring causal control, and optimizing interventions with mechanism-informed AI, translating molecular and cellular insights into therapeutic strategies.
