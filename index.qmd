# Research Profile

Before joining UAB, I developed methods for single-cell genomics in cancer research at the Computational Biology Department at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.\

During my postdoc, I worked with Mark Kirkpatrick and David Houle, studying sexual antagonistic selection, the evolution of sexual differentiation, and aging. \

Prior to that, I completed my Ph.D. at the University of Notre Dame, under the guidance of Nora Besansky, where I researched speciation, chromosomal evolution, ecological genomics, and evolutionary genomics. \

Before pursuing my Ph.D., I worked with Charles Taylor at UCLA on evolutionary genetics, though my interests were drawn toward artificial life research. \

We design and engineer combination therapies by mapping epistasis, inferring causal control, and optimizing interventions with mechanism-informed AI, translating molecular and cellular insights into therapeutic strategies.

## Sex Differences and Disease

Males and females share almost the same genome, yet they often differ in appearance, physiology, and disease risk. I study why those differences arise and how they matter for health, tracing how sex-biased selection and sexual antagonism shape genomic architecture over evolutionary timescales and yield consequences in contemporary medicine.

My work focuses on four linked themes. First, I ask which forces leave the deeper imprint on genomes and traits: sexually concordant selection, which pushes both sexes in the same direction, or sexually discordant selection, which benefits one sex while harming the other.

Second, I investigate why sex chromosomes become focal points of conflict, testing whether chromosomal inversions (stretches of DNA flipped end-to-end) act as recombination suppressors that preserve advantageous, sex-specific allele combinations.

Third, I examine how environmental plasticity modulates sex-biased gene expression and shifts the intersexual correlation of expression, allowing organisms to navigate the tug-of-war between male-optimal and female-optimal states.

Finally, I study how aging alters these dynamics as purifying selection weakens, potentially amplifying sex differences in late-onset disease, including cancer.

These ideas motivate my current analyses of clonal evolution in hematopoietic stem cells after cancer therapy. Many patients develop clonal hematopoiesis, in which mutations arise and a subset of stem-cell clones expands. In our cohort, clonal hematopoiesis occurs in 37.2% of patients, with similar incidence in males (35.8%) and females (39.6%), and recurrently involves the same genes in both sexes, including DNMT3A, PPM1D, TET2, and TP53. The subsequent trajectories diverge: in males, mutated clones expand more often and progress to therapy-related blood cancers in 12.4% of cases, whereas progression in females is 3.6%.

These patterns suggest that selection on clones is sex-conditioned. Comparable genetic starting points can yield different outcomes because the surrounding biology—hormonal milieu, immune surveillance, stromal niches, and epigenetic states—reshapes fitness landscapes in sex-specific ways. My model aims to identify which components shift a clone from benign passenger to malignant driver, and how those components change with age.

:::

Sexual dimorphism/antagonism is not a theoretical curiosity confined to sex chromosomes but a living force that shapes disease. By connecting evolutionary principles to measurable cellular mechanisms, we seek to improve risk prediction, refine surveillance, and design therapies that remain effective within the sex-specific and age-dependent constraints imposed by evolution.
