I am a Lead-Computational Research Scientist at the 
<!-- St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. -->
[St. Jude Children's Research Hospital](https://www.stjude.org/).

My research interest includes 

* evolution
* population genetics
* computational biology challenges in areas including
    + infectious diseases 
    + cancer
    + immunology 
    + single-cell genomics 
    + spatial genomics

Before joining St. Jude, I worked with [Mark Kirkpatrick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Kirkpatrick) at the University of Texas, Austin.  I studied genetics and genomics with [Nora Besansky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nora_J._Besansky) at Notre Dame, and ecology and evolutionary biology with [Chuck Taylor](https://dailybruin.com/2013/11/06/ucla-professor-researches-birdsongs-in-mexico-australia) at UCLA.
