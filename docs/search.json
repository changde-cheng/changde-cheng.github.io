    "text": "Abstract\nPrevious efforts to uncover the genetic underpinnings of ongoing ecological speciation of the M and S forms of the African malaria vector Anopheles gambiae revealed two centromere-proximal islands of genetic divergence on X and chromosome 2. Under the assumption of considerable ongoing gene flow between M and S, these persistently divergent genomic islands were widely considered to be ‘speciation islands’. In the course of microarray-based divergence mapping, we discovered a third centromere-associated island of divergence on chromosome 3, which was validated by targeted re-sequencing.\nTo test for genetic association between the divergence islands on all three chromosomes, SNP-based assays were applied in four natural populations of M and S spanning West, Central and East Africa. Genotyping of 517 female M and S mosquitoes revealed nearly complete linkage disequilibrium between the centromeres of the three independently assorting chromosomes.\nThese results suggest that despite the potential for inter-form gene flow through hybridization, actual (realized) gene flow between M and S may be substantially less than commonly assumed and may not explain most shared variation. Moreover, the possibility of very low gene flow calls into question whether diverged pericentromeric regions-characterized by reduced levels of variation and recombination-are in fact instrumental rather than merely incidental to the speciation process."

    "text": "Abstract\nThe association between fitness-related phenotypic traits and an environmental gradient offers one of the best opportunities to study the interplay between natural selection and migration. In cases in which specific genetic variants also show such clinal patterns, it may be possible to uncover the mutations responsible for local adaptation. The malaria vector, Anopheles gambiae, is associated with a latitudinal cline in aridity in Cameroon; a large inversion on chromosome 2L of this mosquito shows large differences in frequency along this cline, with high frequencies of the inverted karyotype present in northern, more arid populations and an almost complete absence of the inverted arrangement in southern populations.\nHere we use a genome resequencing approach to investigate patterns of population divergence along the cline. By sequencing pools of individuals from both ends of the cline as well as in the center of the cline- where the inversion is present in intermediate frequency- we demonstrate almost complete panmixia across collinear parts of the genome and high levels of differentiation in inverted parts of the genome. Sequencing of separate pools of each inversion arrangement in the center of the cline reveals large amounts of gene flux (i.e., gene conversion and double crossovers) even within inverted regions, especially away from the inversion breakpoints. The interplay between natural selection, migration, and gene flux allows us to identify several candidate genes responsible for the match between inversion frequency and environmental variables.\nThese results, coupled with similar conclusions from studies of clinal variation in Drosophila, point to a number of important biological functions associated with local environmental adaptation."

Despite indirect evidence of their adaptive significance, little is known of the phenotypic targets of selection or the underlying genetic mechanisms.\nHere we adopt a systems genetics approach to explore the interaction of two inversions on opposite arms of chromosome 2 with gender, climatic conditions, and one another. We measure organismal traits and transcriptional profiles in 8-d-old adults of both sexes and four alternative homokaryotypic classes reared under two alternative climatic regimes. We show that karyotype strongly influences both organismal traits and transcriptional profiles but that the strength and direction of the effects depend upon complex interactions with gender and environmental conditions and between inversions on independent arms.\nOur data support the suppressed recombination model for the role of inversions in local adaptation, and-supported by transcriptional and physiological measurements following perturbation with the drug rapamycin-suggest that one mechanism underlying their adaptive role may be the maintenance of energy homeostasis."

However, because of obstacles posed by repeat-rich heterochromatin, knowledge of Y chromosome sequences is limited to a handful of model organisms, constraining our understanding of Y biology across the tree of life.\nHere, we leverage long single-molecule sequencing to determine the content and structure of the nonrecombining Y chromosome of the primary African malaria mosquito, Anopheles gambiae We find that the An. gambiae Y consists almost entirely of a few massively amplified, tandemly arrayed repeats, some of which can recombine with similar repeats on the X chromosome. Sex-specific genome resequencing in a recent species radiation, the An. gambiae complex, revealed rapid sequence turnover within An. gambiae and among species. Exploiting 52 sex-specific An. gambiae RNA-Seq datasets representing all developmental stages, we identified a small repertoire of Y-linked genes that lack X gametologs and are not Y-linked in any other species except An. gambiae, with the notable exception of YG2, a candidate male-determining gene. YG2 is the only gene conserved and exclusive to the Y in all species examined, yet sequence similarity to YG2 is not detectable in the genome of a more distant mosquito relative, suggesting rapid evolution of Y chromosome genes in this highly dynamic genus of malaria vectors.\nThe extensive characterization of the An. gambiae Y provides a long-awaited foundation for studying male mosquito biology, and will inform novel mosquito control strategies based on the manipulation of Y chromosomes."

While there is an intimate connection between sex-biased gene expression and sex-specific selection, few empirical studies have studied this relationship directly. Here we compare the two on a genome-wide scale in humans and flies. We find a distinctive \"Twin Peaks\" pattern in humans that relates the strength of sex-specific selection, quantified by genetic divergence between male and female adults at autosomal loci, to the degree of sex-biased expression. Genes with intermediate degrees of sex-biased expression show evidence of ongoing sex-specific selection, while genes with either little or completely sex-biased expression do not. This pattern apparently results from differential viability selection in males and females acting in the current generation. The Twin Peaks pattern is also found in Drosophila using a different measure of sex-specific selection acting on fertility. We develop a simple model that successfully recapitulates the Twin Peaks. Our results suggest that many genes with intermediate sex-biased expression experience ongoing sex-specific selection in humans and flies."

    "text": "Abstract\nSingle-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a powerful tool for characterizing the cell-to-cell variation and cellular dynamics in populations which appear homogeneous otherwise in basic and translational biological research. However, significant challenges arise in the analysis of scRNA-seq data, including the low signal-to-noise ratio with high data sparsity, potential batch effects, scalability problems when hundreds of thousands of cells are to be analyzed among others. The inherent complexities of scRNA-seq data and dynamic nature of cellular processes lead to suboptimal performance of many currently available algorithms, even for basic tasks such as identifying biologically meaningful heterogeneous subpopulations.\nIn this study, we developed the Latent Cellular Analysis (LCA), a machine learning-based analytical pipeline that combines cosine-similarity measurement by latent cellular states with a graph-based clustering algorithm. LCA provides heuristic solutions for population number inference, dimension reduction, feature selection, and control of technical variations without explicit gene filtering. We show that LCA is robust, accurate, and powerful by comparison with multiple state-of-the-art computational methods when applied to large-scale real and simulated scRNA-seq data. Importantly, the ability of LCA to learn from representative subsets of the data provides scalability, thereby addressing a significant challenge posed by growing sample sizes in scRNA-seq data analysis."

Here, we report that in Drosophila, X-linked inversions also capture 67% more genes. We estimated the number of genes captured through an approximate Bayesian computational analysis of gene orders in nine species of Drosophila. X-linked inversions fixed with a significantly larger gene content. Further, X-linked inversions of intermediate size enjoy highest fixation rate, while the fixation rate of autosomal inversions decreases with size. A less detailed analysis in Anopheles suggests a similar pattern holds in mosquitoes. We develop a population genetic model that assumes the fitness effects of inversions scale with the number of genes captured. We show that the same conditions that lead to a higher fixation rate also produce a larger size for inversions on the X."

    "text": "Abstract\nSexual dimorphism is often assumed to result from balancing the strength of antagonistic selection in favor of dimorphism against the degree of constraint imposed by the shared genome of the sexes, reflected in the \\(\\mathbf B\\) matrix of genetic intersexual covariances.\nTo investigate the totality of forces shaping dimorphism, we reparameterized the Lande equation to predict changes in trait averages and trait differences between the sexes. As genetic constraints on the evolution of dimorphism in response to antagonistic selection become larger, dimorphism will tend to respond more rapidly to concordant selection (which favors the same direction of change in male and female traits) than to antagonistic selection. When we apply this theory to four empirical estimates of \\(\\mathbf B\\) in Drosophila melanogaster, the indirect responses of dimorphism to concordant selection are of comparable or larger magnitude than the direct responses of dimorphism to antagonistic selection in two suites of traits with typical levels of intersex correlation. Antagonistic selection is more important in two suites of traits where the intersex correlations are unusually low. This suggests that the evolution of sexual dimorphism may sometimes be dominated by concordant selection rather than antagonistic selection."

    "text": "Abstract\nLife history theory predicts that the intensity of selection declines with age, and this trend should impact how genes expressed at different ages evolve. Here we find consistent relationships between a gene’s age of expression and patterns of molecular evolution in two mammals (the human Homo sapiens and the mouse Mus musculus) and two insects (the malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae and the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster). When expressed later in life, genes fix nonsynonymous mutations more frequently, are more polymorphic for nonsynonymous mutations, and have shorter evolutionary lifespans, relative to those expressed early. The latter pattern is explained by a simple evolutionary model. Further, early-expressed genes tend to be enriched in similar gene ontology terms across species, while late-expressed genes show no such consistency. In humans, late-expressed genes are more likely to be linked to cancer and to segregate for dominant disease-causing mutations. Last, the effective strength of selection (Ne s) decreases and the fraction of beneficial mutations increases with a gene’s age of expression.\nThese results are consistent with the diminishing efficacy of purifying selection with age, as proposed by Medawar’s classic hypothesis for the evolution of senescence, and provide links between life history theory and molecular evolution."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nSexual dimorphism in gene expression is likely to be the underlying source of dimorphism in a variety of traits. Many analyses implicitly make the assumption that dimorphism only evolves when selection favors different phenotypes in the two sexes, although theory makes clear that it can also evolve as an indirect response to other kinds of selection. Furthermore, previous analyses consider the evolution of a single transcript or trait at a time, ignoring the genetic covariance with other transcripts and traits.\nWe first show which aspects of the genetic-variance-covariance matrix, \\(\\mathbf G\\), affect dimorphism when these assumptions about selection are relaxed. We then reanalyze gene expression data from Drosophila melanogaster with these predictions in mind. Dimorphism of gene expression for individual transcripts shows the signature of both direct selection for dimorphism and indirect responses to selection. To account for the effect of measurement error on evolutionary predictions, we estimated a G matrix for eight linear combinations of expression traits. Sex-specific genetic variances in female- and male-biased transcription, as well as one relatively unbiased combination, were quite unequal, ensuring that most forms of selection on these traits will have large effects on dimorphism.\nPredictions of response to selection based on the whole \\(\\mathbf G\\) matrix showed that sexually concordant and antagonistic selection are equally capable of changing sexual dimorphism. In addition, the indirect responses of dimorphism due to cross-trait covariances were quite substantial. The assumption that sexual dimorphism in transcription is an adaptation could be incorrect in many specific cases."

    "text": "(Submission to the 2017 Society for Molecular Biology & Evolution meeting at Austin, TX.)\n\nResearch Summary\nWhy do females and males differ (Darwin 1871)? What are the evolutionary forces behind the differences between the sexes? Sexually antagonistic selection (“SA selection”), which increases the fitness of an allele in one sex and decreases it in the other (Fisher 1958, Arnqvist and Rowe 2005), is a top candidate. SA selection is also thought to be important in the evolution of sex chromosomes by favoring reduced recombination between sex determining loci and loci under SA selection (van Doorn and Kirkpatrick 2007).\nDespite its theoretical importance, we know little about the strength and genomic targets of SA selection in natural populations. SA selection can be widespread in the genome. Eight percent of genes have been estimated to be under SA selection in Drosophila by measuring fitness of females and males in the lab (Innocenti and Morrow 2010). However, there is little understanding on the strength and targets of SA selection in natural populations (Cheng and Kirkpatrick 2016).\nSex chromosomes offer unique opportunities to advance our understanding of SA selection. Theory predicts genes under SA selection should be enriched on sex chromosomes (Rice 1992). Furthermore, SA selection is predicted to cause the evolution of reduced recombination between X and Y (or Z and W) by chromosomal rearrangements (Charlesworth and Charlesworth 1980).\nThe young and still recombining sex chromosomes in Japan Sea stickleback (Gasterosteus nipponicus) provide a rare opportunity to study SA selection. We sequenced and phased whole sex chromosomes by analyzing genetic inheritance in family quartets. We aimed to looking for footprints of SA selection by detecting regions of significantly elevated divergence between X and Y chromosomes. We estimated the strength and targets of SA selection by fitting a population genetics model to the data. We investigated the phenotypic effects of loci under SA selection by integrating results from previous QTL studies. Our study is among the first revealing the nature of the forces acting in earliest stages of sex chromosome evolution using genomic data. Our work will provide insight to evolutionary forces that establish genes with conflicting effects in females and males, which are detrimental to health including our own species.\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{cheng2017,\n  author = {Changde Cheng and Andrius J.

We report a liver-specific MYC-driven hepatoblastoma murine model that faithfully recapitulates the pathological features of mixed fetal and embryonal hepatoblastoma, with transcriptomics resembling the high-risk gene signatures of the human disease. Single-cell RNA-sequencing and spatial transcriptomics identified distinct subpopulations of hepatoblastoma cells. After deriving cell lines from the mouse model, we mapped the cancer dependency genes using CRISPR-Cas9 screening and identified druggable targets shared with human hepatoblastoma (i.e., CDK7, CDK9, PRMT1, PRMT5). Our screen also revealed oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes in hepatoblastoma that engage multiple, druggable cancer signaling pathways. Chemotherapy is critical for human hepatoblastoma treatment. A genetic mapping of doxorubicin response by CRISPR-Cas9 screening identified modifiers whose loss-of-function synergizes with (e.g., PRKDC) or antagonizes (e.g., apoptosis genes) with the effect of chemotherapy. The combination of PRKDC inhibition and doxorubicin-based chemotherapy greatly enhances therapeutic efficacy. These studies have provided a useful set of resources including disease models suitable to identify and validate potential therapeutic targets in human high-risk hepatoblastoma."

    "text": "Abstract\nIn the malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae polymorphic chromosomal inversions may play an important role in adaptation to environmental variation.\nRecently, we used microarray-based divergence mapping combined with targeted resequencing to map nucleotide differentiation between alternative arrangements of the 2La inversion. Here, we applied the same technique to four different polymorphic inversions on the 2R chromosome of An. gambiae. Surprisingly, divergence was much lower between alternative arrangements for all 2R inversions when compared to the 2La inversion. For one of the rearrangements, 2Ru, we successfully mapped a very small region (approximately 100 kb) of elevated divergence. For the other three rearrangements, we did not identify any regions of significantly high divergence, despite ample independent evidence from natural populations of geographic clines and seasonal cycling, and stable heterotic polymorphisms in laboratory populations.\nIf these inversions are the targets of selection as hypothesized, we suggest that divergence between rearrangements may have escaped detection due to retained ancestral polymorphism in the case of the youngest 2R rearrangements and to extensive gene flux in the older 2R inversion systems that segregate in both An. gambiae and its sibling species An. arabiensis."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nThe African malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae is diversifying into ecotypes known as M and S forms. This process is thought to be promoted by adaptation to different larval habitats, but its genetic underpinnings remain elusive. To identify candidate targets of divergent natural selection in M and S, we performed genomewide scanning in paired population samples from Mali, followed by resequencing and genotyping from five locations in West, Central, and East Africa.\nGenome scans revealed a significant peak of M-S divergence on chromosome 3L, overlapping five known or suspected immune response genes. Resequencing implicated a selective target at or near the TEP1 gene, whose complement C3-like product has antiparasitic and antibacterial activity. Sequencing and allele-specific genotyping showed that an allelic variant of TEP1 has been swept to fixation in M samples from Mali and Burkina Faso and is spreading into neighboring Ghana, but is absent from M sampled in Cameroon, and from all sampled S populations.\nSequence comparison demonstrates that this allele is related to, but distinct from, TEP1 alleles of known resistance phenotype. Experimental parasite infections of advanced mosquito intercrosses demonstrated a strong association between this TEP1 variant and resistance to both rodent malaria and the native human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. Although malaria parasites may not be direct agents of pathogen-mediated selection at TEP1 in nature–where larvae may be the more vulnerable life stage–the process of adaptive divergence between M and S has potential consequences for malaria transmission."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nThe African malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae is polymorphic for chromosomal inversion 2La, whose frequency strongly correlates with degree of aridity across environmental gradients. Recent physiological studies have associated 2La with resistance to desiccation in adults and thermal stress in larvae, consistent with its proposed role in aridity tolerance. However, the genetic basis of these traits remains unknown.\nTo identify genes that could be involved in the differential response to thermal stress, we compared global gene expression profiles of heat-hardened 2La or 2L+(a) larvae at three time points, for up to eight hours following exposure to the heat stress. Treatment and control time series, replicated four times, revealed a common and massive induction of a core set of heat-shock genes regardless of 2La orientation. However, clear differences between the 2La and 2L+(a) arrangements emerged at the earliest (0.25 h) time point, in the intensity and nature of the stress response. Overall, 2La was associated with the more aggressive response: larger numbers of genes were heat responsive and up-regulated. Transcriptionally induced genes were enriched for functions related to ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation, chaperoning and energy metabolism. The more muted transcriptional response of 2L+(a) was largely repressive, including genes involved in proteolysis and energy metabolism.\nThese results may help explain the maintenance of the 2La inversion polymorphism in An. gambiae, as the survival benefits offered by high thermal sensitivity in harsh climates could be offset by the metabolic costs of such a drastic response in more equable climates."

    "title": "Cuticular differences associated with aridity acclimation in African malaria vectors carrying alternative arrangements of inversion 2La",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nPrincipal malaria vectors in Africa, An. gambiae and An. coluzzii, share an inversion polymorphism on the left arm of chromosome 2 (2La/2L+a) that is distributed non-randomly in the environment. Genomic sequencing studies support the role of strong natural selection in maintaining steep clines in 2La inversion frequency along environmental gradients of aridity, and physiological studies have directly implicated 2La in heat and desiccation tolerance, but the precise genetic basis and the underlying behavioral and physiological mechanisms remain unknown. As the insect cuticle is the primary barrier to water loss, differences in cuticle thickness and/or epicuticular waterproofing associated with alternative 2La arrangements might help explain differences in desiccation resistance. METHODS: To test that hypothesis, two subcolonies of both An. gambiae and An. coluzzii were established that were fixed for alternative 2La arrangements (2La or 2L+a) on an otherwise homosequential and shared genetic background. Adult mosquitoes reared under controlled environmental conditions (benign or arid) for eight days post-eclosion were collected and analyzed. Measurements of cuticle thickness were made based on scanning electron microscopy, and cuticular hydrocarbon (CHC) composition was evaluated by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. RESULTS: After removing the allometric effects of body weight, differences in mean cuticle thickness were found between alternative 2La karyotypes, but not between alternative environments. Moreover, the thicker cuticle of the An. coluzzii 2La karyotype was contrary to the known higher rate of water loss of this karyotype relative to 2L+a. On the other hand, quantitative differences in individual CHCs and overall CHC profiles between alternative karyotypes and environmental conditions were consistent with expectation based on previous physiological studies. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that alternative arrangements of the 2La inversion are associated with differences in cuticle thickness and CHC composition, but that only CHC composition appears to be relevant for desiccation resistance. Differences in the CHC composition were consistent with previous findings of a lower rate of water loss for the 2L+a karyotype at eight days post-eclosion, suggesting that CHC composition is an important strategy for maintaining water balance in this genetic background, but not for 2La. Despite a higher rate of water loss at eight days, higher body water content of the 2La karyotype confers a level of desiccation resistance equivalent to that of the 2L+a karyotype."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nDivergent selection based on aquatic larval ecology is a likely factor in the recent isolation of two broadly sympatric and morphologically identical African mosquito species, the malaria vectors Anopheles gambiae and An. coluzzii. Population-based genome scans have revealed numerous candidate regions of recent positive selection, but have provided few clues as to the genetic mechanisms underlying behavioural and physiological divergence between the two species, phenotypes which themselves remain obscure.\nTo uncover possible genetic mechanisms, we compared global transcriptional profiles of natural and experimental populations using gene-based microarrays. Larvae were sampled as second and fourth instars from natural populations in and around the city of Yaounde, capital of Cameroon, where the two species segregate along a gradient of urbanization.\nFunctional enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes revealed that An. coluzzii–the species that breeds in more stable, biotically complex and potentially polluted urban water bodies–overexpresses genes implicated in detoxification and immunity relative to An. gambiae, which breeds in more ephemeral and relatively depauperate pools and puddles in suburbs and rural areas. Moreover, our data suggest that such overexpression by An. coluzzii is not a transient result of induction by xenobiotics in the larval habitat, but an inherent and presumably adaptive response to repeatedly encountered environmental stressors. Finally, we find no significant overlap between the differentially expressed loci and previously identified genomic regions of recent positive selection, suggesting that transcriptome divergence is regulated by trans-acting factors rather than cis-acting elements."

    "text": "Abstract\nAlthough freshwater is the ancestral habitat for larval mosquitoes, multiple species independently evolved the ability to survive in saltwater. Here, we use quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping to investigate the genetic architecture of osmoregulation in Anopheles mosquitoes, vectors of human malaria.\nWe analyzed 1134 backcross progeny from a cross between the obligate freshwater species An. coluzzii, and its closely related euryhaline sibling species An. merus. Tests of 2387 markers with Bayesian interval mapping and machine learning (random forests) yielded six genomic regions associated with saltwater tolerance. Overlap in QTL regions from both approaches enhances confidence in QTL identification.\nEvidence exists for synergistic as well as disruptive epistasis among loci. Intriguingly, one QTL region containing ion transporters spans the 2Rop chromosomal inversion that distinguishes these species. Rather than a simple trait controlled by one or a few loci, our data are most consistent with a complex, polygenic mode of inheritance."

    "text": "Abstract\nEvolution of osmoregulatory systems is a key factor in the transition of species between fresh- and saltwater habitats. Anopheles coluzzii and Anopheles merus are stenohaline and euryhaline malaria vector mosquitoes belonging to a larger group of sibling species, the Anopheles gambiae complex, which radiated in Africa within the last 2 million years. Comparative ecological genomics of these vector species can provide insight into the mechanisms that permitted the rapid radiation of this species complex into habitats of contrasting salinity.\nHere, we use RNA-Seq to investigate gene expression differences between An. coluzzii and An. merus after briefly exposing both young and old larval instars of each species to either saltwater (SW) or freshwater (FW). Our study aims to identify candidate genes and pathways responsible for the greater SW tolerance of An. merus. Our results are congruent with the ability of gene induction to mediate salinity tolerance, with both species showing increasing amounts of differential gene expression between SW and FW as salt concentrations increase. Besides ion transporters such as AgAE2 that may serve as effectors for osmoregulation, we also find mitogen-activated protein kinases that may serve in a phosphorylation signalling pathway responding to salinity, and report potential cross-talk between the mosquito immune response and osmoregulation.\nThis study provides a key step towards applying the growing molecular knowledge of these malaria vectors to improve understanding of their ecological tolerances and habitat occupancy."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nMechanisms and evolutionary dynamics of sex-determination systems are of particular interest in insect vectors of human pathogens like mosquitoes because novel control strategies aim to convert pathogen-transmitting females into nonbiting males, or rely on accurate sexing for the release of sterile males. In Aedes aegypti, the main vector of dengue and Zika viruses, sex determination is governed by a dominant male-determining locus, previously thought to reside within a small, nonrecombining, sex-determining region (SDR) of an otherwise homomorphic sex chromosome. Here, we provide evidence that sex chromosomes in Ae. aegypti are genetically differentiated between males and females over a region much larger than the SDR. Our linkage mapping intercrosses failed to detect recombination between X and Y chromosomes over a 123-Mbp region (40% of their physical length) containing the SDR. This region of reduced male recombination overlapped with a smaller 63-Mbp region (20% of the physical length of the sex chromosomes) displaying high male-female genetic differentiation in unrelated wild populations from Brazil and Australia and in a reference laboratory strain originating from Africa. In addition, the sex-differentiated genomic region was associated with a significant excess of male-to-female heterozygosity and contained a small cluster of loci consistent with Y-specific null alleles. We demonstrate that genetic differentiation between sex chromosomes is sufficient to assign individuals to their correct sex with high accuracy. We also show how data on allele frequency differences between sexes can be used to estimate linkage disequilibrium between loci and the sex-determining locus. Our discovery of large-scale genetic differentiation between sex chromosomes in Ae. aegypti lays a new foundation for mapping and population genomic studies, as well as for mosquito control strategies targeting the sex-determination pathway."

    "text": "Abstract\nIntersexual genetic correlations are expected to constrain the evolution of sexual dimorphic traits, including the degree of sex-biased gene expression. Consistent with that expectation, studies in fruit flies and birds have reported that genes whose expression has a strong intersexual genetic correlation (\\(r_{\\mathrm{MF}}\\)) show a lower level of sex-biased expression. However, it is known that both \\(r_{\\mathrm{MF}}\\) and sex-biased expression can be affected by the environment. It is therefore unclear whether there is a consistent relationship between these 2 quantities across multiple environments.\nIn this paper, we study this relationship in the African malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae. We show that both \\(r_{\\mathrm{MF}}\\) and sex-biased expression change between environments. The change in sex-biased expression across environments is significantly correlated with dN/dS: greater changes in sex-biased expression are associated with higher values of dN/dS. Furthermore, the relationship between \\(r_{\\mathrm{MF}}\\) and sex-biased expression is sensitive to the environment. We conclude that this relationship is sufficiently plastic that environmental effects should be considered in future studies."

    "text": "Abstract\nThe interaction between extrinsic factors and intrinsic signal strength governs thymocyte development, but the mechanisms linking them remain elusive.\nWe report that mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) couples microenvironmental cues with metabolic programs to orchestrate the reciprocal development of two fundamentally distinct T cell lineages, the alphabeta and gammadelta T cells. Developing thymocytes dynamically engage metabolic programs including glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, as well as mTORC1 signaling. Loss of RAPTOR-mediated mTORC1 activity impairs the development of alphabeta T cells but promotes gammadelta T cell generation, associated with disrupted metabolic remodeling of oxidative and glycolytic metabolism.\nMechanistically, we identify mTORC1-dependent control of reactive oxygen species production as a key metabolic signal in mediating alphabeta and gammadelta T cell development, and perturbation of redox homeostasis impinges upon thymocyte fate decisions and mTORC1-associated phenotypes. Furthermore, single-cell RNA sequencing and genetic dissection reveal that mTORC1 links developmental signals from T cell receptors and NOTCH to coordinate metabolic activity and signal strength. Our results establish mTORC1-driven metabolic signaling as a decisive factor for reciprocal alphabeta and gammadelta T cell development and provide insight into metabolic control of cell signaling and fate decisions."

    "text": "Abstract\nRecombination often differs markedly between males and females. Here we present the first analysis of sex-specific recombination in Gasterosteus sticklebacks. Using whole-genome sequencing of 15 crosses between G. aculeatus and G. nipponicus, we localized 698 crossovers with a median resolution of 2.3 kb. We also used a bioinformatic approach to infer historical sex-averaged recombination patterns for both species. Recombination is greater in females than males on all chromosomes, and overall map length is 1.64 times longer in females. The locations of crossovers differ strikingly between sexes. Crossovers cluster toward chromosome ends in males, but are distributed more evenly across chromosomes in females. Suppression of recombination near the centromeres in males causes crossovers to cluster at the ends of long arms in acrocentric chromosomes, and greatly reduces crossing over on short arms. The effect of centromeres on recombination is much weaker in females. Genomic differentiation between G. aculeatus and G. nipponicus is strongly correlated with recombination rate, and patterns of differentiation along chromosomes are strongly influenced by male-specific telomere and centromere effects. We found no evidence for fine-scale correlations between recombination and local gene content in either sex. We discuss hypotheses for the origin of sexual dimorphism in recombination and its consequences for sexually antagonistic selection and sex chromosome evolution."

    "text": "Abstract\nPhotoperiod is a key environmental cue affecting flowering and biomass traits in plants. Key components of the photoperiodic flowering pathway have been identified in many species, but surprisingly few studies have globally examined the diurnal rhythm of gene expression with changes in day length.\nUsing a cost-effective 3’-Tag RNA sequencing strategy, we characterize 9,010 photoperiod responsive genes with strict statistical testing across a diurnal time series in the C4 perennial grass, Panicum hallii.\nWe show that the vast majority of photoperiod responses are driven by complex interactions between day length and sampling periods. A fine-scale contrast analysis at each sampling time revealed a detailed picture of the temporal reprogramming of cis-regulatory elements and biological processes under short- and long-day conditions. Phase shift analysis reveals quantitative variation among genes with photoperiod-dependent diurnal patterns. In addition, we identify three photoperiod enriched transcription factor families with key genes involved in photoperiod flowering regulatory networks. Finally, coexpression networks analysis of GIGANTEA homolog predicted 1,668 potential coincidence partners, including five well-known GI-interacting proteins. Our results not only provide a resource for understanding the mechanisms of photoperiod regulation in perennial grasses but also lay a foundation to increase biomass yield in biofuel crops."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nRhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), a cancer characterized by features of skeletal muscle, is the most common soft-tissue sarcoma of childhood. With 5-year survival rates among high-risk groups at <30%, new therapeutics are desperately needed. Previously, using a myoblast-based model of fusion-negative RMS (FN-RMS), we found that expression of the Hippo pathway effector transcriptional coactivator YAP1 (YAP1) permitted senescence bypass and subsequent transformation to malignant cells, mimicking FN-RMS. We also found that YAP1 engages in a positive feedback loop with Notch signaling to promote FN-RMS tumorigenesis. However, we could not identify an immediate downstream impact of this Hippo-Notch relationship. Here, we identify a HES1-YAP1-CDKN1C functional interaction, and show that knockdown of the Notch effector HES1 (Hes family BHLH transcription factor 1) impairs growth of multiple FN-RMS cell lines, with knockdown resulting in decreased YAP1 and increased CDKN1C expression. In-silico mining of published proteomic and transcriptomic profiles of human RMS patient-derived xenografts revealed the same pattern of HES1-YAP1-CDKN1C expression. Treatment of FN-RMS cells in vitro with the recently described HES1 small-molecule inhibitor, JI130, limited FN-RMS cell growth. Inhibition of HES1 in vivo via conditional expression of a HES1-directed shRNA or JI130 dosing impaired FN-RMS tumor xenograft growth. Lastly, targeted transcriptomic profiling of FN-RMS xenografts in the context of HES1 suppression identified associations between HES1 and RAS-MAPK signaling. In summary, these in vitro and in vivo preclinical studies support the further investigation of HES1 as a therapeutic target in FN-RMS."
