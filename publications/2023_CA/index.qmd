### Context and significance

Brain injury is the leading cause of death among patients hospitalized after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Although inflammation is associated with brain injury and mortality after cardiac arrest, the immune landscape after cardiac arrest is poorly understood. By examining peripheral blood at single-cell resolution, this study shows that examining the innate immune system just 6 h after cardiac arrest differentiates patients who eventually have good or poor neurological outcomes days later. Cardiac arrest triggers an early negative feedback loop in which pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines induce immune checkpoints that limit inflammation. These findings support investigation of therapeutic approaches that augment protective immune mechanisms very early after cardiac arrest.
