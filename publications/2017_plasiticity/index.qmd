### Abstract

Intersexual genetic correlations are expected to constrain the evolution of sexual dimorphic traits, including the degree of sex-biased gene expression. Consistent with that expectation, studies in fruit flies and birds have reported that genes whose expression has a strong intersexual genetic correlation ($r_{\mathrm{MF}}$) show a lower level of sex-biased expression. However, it is known that both $r_{\mathrm{MF}}$ and sex-biased expression can be affected by the environment. It is therefore unclear whether there is a consistent relationship between these 2 quantities across multiple environments. 

In this paper, we study this relationship in the African malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae. We show that both $r_{\mathrm{MF}}$ and sex-biased expression change between environments. The change in sex-biased expression across environments is significantly correlated with dN/dS: greater changes in sex-biased expression are associated with higher values of dN/dS. Furthermore, the relationship between $r_{\mathrm{MF}}$ and sex-biased expression is sensitive to the environment. We conclude that this relationship is sufficiently plastic that environmental effects should be considered in future studies.
