I am an asistant professor in Stem Cell Biology Program and Institute for Cancer Outcomes and Survivorship at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.  I study computational and evolutionary genomics focusing on stem cells, in the context of aging,  critical illness, and cancer, aiming to understand the link between cellular dynamics and disease initiation, progression, and treatment outcomes.

**Therapy Design and Engineering**  

Our lab studies how combinations of genes, pathways, and cell types shape cellular decision-making and tissue repair. Using combinatorial Perturb-seq and single-cell/spatial multi-omics, we map high-dimensional interaction landscapes and quantify epistasis at single-cell resolution. We integrate these data with mechanism-informed, multimodal dynamical models to infer causal circuits, forecast synergy vs. antagonism, and identify robust control points. We then translate these “design rules” into combination interventions: from CRISPR perturbations and drug pairs to compositionally tuned cellular therapies. One current project is on retinal vascular repair, where we compose iPSC-derived CD34⁺ progenitors and ECFCs to rebuild vessels and correct immune–stromal dysregulation. The same framework generalizes to cancer and immunology, where we model the tumor microenvironment, predict resistance trajectories, and design evolution-aware therapeutic combinations. We aim to turn complex biology into predictable, engineerable systems, and deliver therapies that work precisely.
