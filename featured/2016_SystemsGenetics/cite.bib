 abstract = {Inversion polymorphisms in the African malaria vector Anopheles gambiae segregate along climatic gradients of aridity. Despite indirect evidence of their adaptive significance, little is known of the phenotypic targets of selection or the underlying genetic mechanisms. Here we adopt a systems genetics approach to explore the interaction of two inversions on opposite arms of chromosome 2 with gender, climatic conditions, and one another. We measure organismal traits and transcriptional profiles in 8-d-old adults of both sexes and four alternative homokaryotypic classes reared under two alternative climatic regimes. We show that karyotype strongly influences both organismal traits and transcriptional profiles but that the strength and direction of the effects depend upon complex interactions with gender and environmental conditions and between inversions on independent arms. Our data support the suppressed recombination model for the role of inversions in local adaptation, and-supported by transcriptional and physiological measurements following perturbation with the drug rapamycin-suggest that one mechanism underlying their adaptive role may be the maintenance of energy homeostasis.},
