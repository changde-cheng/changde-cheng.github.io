As a research scientist at <u>St. Jude</u>, I develop machine learning applications focusing on cancer research (single-cell sequencing, spatial genomics, and multi-omics).  I also collaborate with colleagues interested in other biomedical and life sciences fields.

Before joining St. Jude, I led research projects on evolution and population genomics at the <u>University of Texas, Austin</u>.  Earlier than that, I worked on infectious diseases and genomics at <u>Notre Dame</u>, and I did statistical modeling at <u>UCLA</u>. 

I walk my dog when I am not working.
