As a research scientist in the Department of Computational Biology at [St. Jude Children's Research Hospital](https://www.stjude.org/), I develop machine learning applications focusing on cancer research (single-cell sequencing, spatial genomics, and multi-omics).  I also collaborate with colleagues interested in other biomedical and life sciences fields.
