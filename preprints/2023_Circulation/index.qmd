Anthracyclines induce cardiotoxicity via DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, resulting in cardiomyocyte dysfunction. The role of DNA damage response/repair (DDR) genes in anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy remains unstudied. We conducted a gene-based and pathway-based analysis to examine main-effect and gene-anthracycline interaction effect between DDR genes and anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy. A discovery analysis performed with a matched case-control set of anthracycline-exposed non-Hispanic White childhood cancer survivors from COG-ALTE03N1 was replicated using a cohort of anthracycline-exposed non-Hispanic White childhood cancer survivors from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study cohort. Functional analyses were performed by examining response to doxorubicin of human induced pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CM) with CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of candidate genes. Our findings provide evidence for the role of DDR genes and pathways in anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy and provide a framework for targeted therapeutic targets.
