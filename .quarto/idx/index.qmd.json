We focus on identifying specific tumor cell subpopulations responsible for relapse and understanding how microenvironments influence their response to chemotherapy. We've developed high-performance machine-learning tools for single-cell analysis, enabling accurate subpopulation estimation and clustering.

Our goal is to translate these insights into clinical practice for better identifying patients at risk of disease recurrence, thus improving the precision treatment and outcome of cancer.\n\n>1.\tCheng C, Easton J, Rosencrance C, Li Y, Ju B, Williams J, Mulder HL, Pang Y, Chen W, Chen X.

What is the evolutionary origin of cancer? Why do females differ from males? What are the evolutionary forces shaping the differences between the sexes? I have used statistical and population genetics modeling and genomics data analysis to tackle these fundamental questions. We study the relation between molecular evolution, genetic variation patterns, and age-dependent gene expression, and our findings suggest that selection against deleterious mutations gets less efficient with age. We developed a population genetics model to show a high risk of loss of function when the strength of selection is weak. This may explain why late-expressed genes appear to have short lifespans and are more likely to contribute to cancer. For the evolution of sexual dimorphism, we have developed a theory suggesting that the canonical scenario for the evolution of sexual dimorphism by antagonistic selection may be less widely applicable than believed. We used a geometrical approach to show how the evolution of dimorphism responds to selection under a strong genetic constraint. \n\n>1.\tCheng C, Kirkpatrick M.
