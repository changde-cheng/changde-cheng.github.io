David Houle and I have suggested that many cases of sexual dimorphism may in fact arise from concordant selection, rather than from conflict between the sexes.

As purifying selection weakens, late-acting mutations, and sex differences in disease, grow more visible. With Mark Kirkpatrick, I examined how the force of natural selection changes over the lifespan and how this affects the molecular evolution of genes. We found that mutations expressed late in life are less efficiently removed, with shorter genomic lifespans, consistent with theoretical predictions about how aging evolves through the weakening of selection.\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"false\" appearance=\"minimal\" style=\"background-color: honeydew; border-color: gray;\"}\n# Read more\n[ \\[Aging and molecular eovlution\\] ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8113359/) \\\n:::\n\nThese ideas motivate my current analyses of clonal evolution in hematopoietic stem cells after cancer therapy. Many patients develop clonal hematopoiesis, in which mutations arise and a subset of stem-cell clones expands. In our cohort, clonal hematopoiesis occurs in 37.2% of patients, with similar incidence in males (35.8%) and females (39.6%), and recurrently involves the same genes in both sexes, including DNMT3A, PPM1D, TET2, and TP53. The subsequent trajectories diverge: in males, mutated clones expand more often and progress to therapy-related blood cancers in 12.4% of cases, whereas progression in females is 3.6%. \n\n::: {.text-center}\n**Mutations persist, expand, or disappear during disease progression,  associated with specific chromosomal abnormalities across biological groups.**\n:::\n\n![](publications/2024_sextmn/featured.png)\n\nThese patterns suggest that selection on clones is sex-conditioned. Comparable genetic starting points can yield different outcomes because the surrounding biology, hormonal milieu, immune surveillance, stromal niches, and epigenetic states, reshapes fitness landscapes in sex-specific ways. My model aims to identify which components shift a clone from benign passenger to malignant driver, and how those components change with age.\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"false\" appearance=\"minimal\" style=\"background-color: honeydew; border-color: gray;\"}\n# Research highlight\n[ \\[Sex differences in risk for therapy-related myeloid neoplasms\\] ](https://doi.org/10.1200/JCO-24-01487)\n<!-- (publications/2024_sextmn/index.qmd) -->\n:::\n\nSexual discordance is not a theoretical curiosity confined to sex chromosomes but a living force that shapes disease. By connecting evolutionary principles to measurable cellular mechanisms, we seek to improve risk prediction, refine surveillance, and design therapies that remain effective within the sex-specific and age-dependent constraints imposed by evolution.\n\n\n---\n\n## Adaptation, Speciation, and Infectious Disease\n\nMy early work centered on a classical question: how do chromosomal inversions shape adaptation and divergence? This inquiry soon led to a more applied one: how do these same inversions influence disease transmission in malaria mosquitoes? In pursuing these questions, I challenged the prevailing “speciation island” model, showing instead that genomic divergence arises primarily from regions of suppressed recombination.\n\nUsing Anopheles gambiae as a model, I found that inversion 2La tracks Africa’s aridity gradient and forms a **suspension-bridge** pattern of differentiation, confirming that inversions capture locally adapted alleles by suppressing recombination.\n\n::: {style=\"text-align: center;\"}\n![](featured/2012_ecogenomics/Figure2.png)\n:::\n\nLaboratory and transcriptomic analyses further revealed that inversions shape multiple traits, including fecundity, longevity, behavior, and stress tolerance, through interactions with environment and sex. In Anopheles, such structural variation links ecological adaptation with the evolution of vectorial capacity, showing how genomic architecture organizes both ecological and epidemiological diversity.\n\nIn *Genetic association of physically unlinked islands of genomic divergence*, I re-examined the “speciation island” hypothesis. The near absence of gene flow between incipient species suggests that highly diverged pericentromeric regions, marked by low variation and recombination, may be incidental rather than instrumental to speciation—an insight that reframed how genomic divergence and population structure are interpreted in the early stages of species formation.\n\nThese findings connect population genetic theory with ecological and epidemiological dynamics. In malaria mosquitoes, inversions not only stabilize local adaptation but also modulate vectorial capacity, illustrating how genomic architecture organizes both ecological and disease-related diversity.\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"false\" appearance=\"minimal\" style=\"background-color: honeydew; border-color: gray;\"}\n# Read more\n[ \\[Ecological genomics along aridity cline\\] ](https://doi.org/10.1534/genetics.111.137794) \\\n[ \\[Genomics of inversions\\] ](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1806760115) \\\n[ \\[Islands of genomic divergence in speciation\\] ](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2010.04531.x)\n:::\n<!-- [Back to Top](#) -->\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n<!-- Question and biology systems -->\n<!-- Approach -->\n<!-- Significance -->\n\n*Dr. Changde Cheng*\n\nAssistant Professor \\\nStem Cell Biology | Cancer Outcomes and Survivorship | Biomedical Informatics and Data Science \\\nUniversity of Alabama at Birmingham\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\" appearance=\"minimal\" style=\"background-color: honeydew; border-color: gray; color: seagreen;\"}\n# My Profile\n\nBefore joining UAB, I developed methods for single-cell genomics in cancer research at the Computational Biology Department at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.\\\n\nDuring my postdoc, I worked with Mark Kirkpatrick and David Houle, studying sexual antagonistic selection, the evolution of sexual differentiation, and aging. \\\n\nPrior to that, I completed my Ph.D. at the University of Notre Dame, under the guidance of Nora Besansky, where I researched speciation, chromosomal evolution, ecological genomics, and evolutionary genomics. \\\n\nBefore pursuing my Ph.D., I worked with Charles Taylor at UCLA on evolutionary genetics, though my interests were drawn toward artificial life research.
