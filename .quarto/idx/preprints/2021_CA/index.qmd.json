Lymphopenia and elevated cytokine levels suggest a role for the systemic immune response after CA.  We determined the immunological network after clinical CA and identified cell states correlating with poor neurological outcomes using single-cell RNA-sequencing. The results suggest the role of native compensatory mechanisms through immune checkpoint axis to maintain homeostasis during acute inflammation and bring immunomodulation as a potential treatment class after CA.\n\n\nTomoyoshi Tamura<sup>\\#</sup>, Changde Cheng<sup>\\#</sup>, Louis T.
