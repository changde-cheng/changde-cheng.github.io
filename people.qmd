<!-- He started his academic journey at [Peking University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peking_University), one of China’s most prestigious universities.  He continued to pursue his education and training at  [UCLA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Los_Angeles), with Dr. Charles Taylor, a pioneering researcher exploring fundamental questions about language evolution and artificial life; and at the [University of Notre Dame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Notre_Dame), with Dr. [Nora Besansky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nora_J._Besansky), on ecological genomics of adaptation and speciation. -->

<!-- During his postdoctoral fellowship at the [University of Texas at Austin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Texas_at_Austin), he worked with Dr. [Mark Kirkpatrick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Kirkpatrick), in population genetics and theoretical biology, and Dr. [David Houle](https://www.bio.fsu.edu/faculty.php?faculty-id=houle), in quantitative genetics and the evolution of complex traits. After that, he worked as a senior/lead computational research scientist at [St. Jude Children's Research Hospital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Jude_Children%27s_Research_Hospital), a world-renowned institution at the forefront of pediatric cancer research and treatment, where he contributed to their mission of finding cures and saving children's lives. -->

<!-- Currently, he serves as a faculty member and head of bioinformatics in the Stem Cell Program and the Institute for Cancer Outcomes and Survivorship at the Heersink School of Medicine, [University of Alabama at Birmingham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Alabama_at_Birmingham_School_of_Medicine). His work integrates expertise in genetics, bioinformatics, and computational biology to advance understanding and treatment of cancer and other complex diseases. -->

<!-- ## Doug Welsch - Bioinformatician -->

<!-- He earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science from [William Marsh Rice University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice_University), a leading research university in the United States. During his college years, he also pursued a minor in Biochemistry and Cell Biology. As a student researcher at Rice, he worked in Dr. M. Neal [Waxham's lab](https://sites.google.com/uth.edu/waxham-lab/home) at The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, focusing on image analysis of synthetic lipid vesicles under cryo-EM, and co-authored a publication in [*Biophysical Reports*]{.underline}. He also worked in Dr. [Hongjie Li's Lab](https://www.bcm.edu/people-search/hongjie-li-66406) at Baylor College of Medicine under the supervision of Dr. Tzu-Chiao Lu on single-cell data analysis and published a co-authored paper in [*Science*]{.underline}. -->

<!-- ## Brunno Macedo - PhD student -->

<!-- He received a Bachelor's degree in Biomedical Sciences from the [Federal University of Pernambuco in Brazil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_University_of_Pernambuco), where he gained experience in clinical and laboratory hematology while working as a teacher's assistant for both undergraduate and professional specialization courses for two years. He recently completed a Master of Sciences degree from the [University of São Paulo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_S%C3%A3o_Paulo) at Ribeirão Preto Medical School (Internal Medicine Graduate Program). During his Master's program, he conducted research in [Dr. Fabiola Traina's lab](https://rio.fmrp.usp.br/fabiolatraina/), which focuses on molecular alterations and signaling pathways in myeloid neoplasms. Currently, Brunno is a PhD student at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. -->
