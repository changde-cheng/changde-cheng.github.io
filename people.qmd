**Principal Investigator**

Dr. Changde Cheng started his academic journey at [Peking University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peking_University), the top university in China.  He later moved to the United States to pursue his education and training at  [UCLA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Los_Angeles), under the guidance of Dr. Charles Taylor in ecology and evolution, and at the [University of Notre Dame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Notre_Dame), with Dr. [Nora Besansky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nora_J._Besansky) in genetics and infectious diseases. During his postdoctoral fellowship at the [University of Texas at Austin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Texas_at_Austin), he worked with Dr. [Mark Kirkpatrick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Kirkpatrick) in population genetics and theoretical biology, and Dr. [David Houle](https://www.bio.fsu.edu/faculty.php?faculty-id=houle) in quantitative genetics. After that, he worked as a senior/lead computational research scientist at [St. Jude Children's Research Hospital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Jude_Children%27s_Research_Hospital), one of the top research hospitals in the country. He currently serves as a faculty member in the Stem Cell Program at the Heersink School of Medicine, [University of Alabama at Birmingham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Alabama_at_Birmingham_School_of_Medicine).




<!-- Dr. Changde Cheng completed his undergraduate degree in Genetics and Cell Biology from [Peking University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peking_University), followed by an M.A. in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology from [UCLA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Los_Angeles). He then pursued his Ph.D. from the Department of Biological Sciences at the [University of Notre Dame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Notre_Dame). Afterward, he joined the Center for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics at the [University of Texas at Austin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Texas_at_Austin) as a postdoctoral fellow. He later worked as a lead/senior computational research scientist in the Department of Computational Biology at [St. Jude Children's Research Hospital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Jude_Children%27s_Research_Hospital) before joining the faculty of the Division of Hematology/Oncology at [Heersink School of Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Alabama_at_Birmingham_School_of_Medicine) in 2023. -->
