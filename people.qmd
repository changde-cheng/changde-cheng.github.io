<!-- He started his academic journey at [Peking University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peking_University), one of China’s most prestigious universities.  He continued to pursue his education and training at  [UCLA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Los_Angeles), with Dr. Charles Taylor, a pioneering researcher exploring fundamental questions about language evolution and artificial life; and at the [University of Notre Dame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Notre_Dame), with Dr. [Nora Besansky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nora_J._Besansky), on ecological genomics of adaptation and speciation. -->

<!-- During his postdoctoral fellowship at the [University of Texas at Austin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Texas_at_Austin), he worked with Dr. [Mark Kirkpatrick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Kirkpatrick), in population genetics and theoretical biology, and Dr. [David Houle](https://www.bio.fsu.edu/faculty.php?faculty-id=houle), in quantitative genetics and the evolution of complex traits. After that, he worked as a senior/lead computational research scientist at [St. Jude Children's Research Hospital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Jude_Children%27s_Research_Hospital), a world-renowned institution at the forefront of pediatric cancer research and treatment, where he contributed to their mission of finding cures and saving children's lives. -->

<!-- Currently, he serves as a faculty member and head of bioinformatics in the Stem Cell Program and the Institute for Cancer Outcomes and Survivorship at the Heersink School of Medicine, [University of Alabama at Birmingham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Alabama_at_Birmingham_School_of_Medicine). His work integrates expertise in genetics, bioinformatics, and computational biology to advance understanding and treatment of cancer and other complex diseases. -->

## The Research Champions

### Dr.  Venkata Krishna Chaithanya Manam

[Superpower]{style="font-weight: 500; color:seagreen;"}:  Bridging artificial intelligence and biological discovery through advanced NLP, LLMs, and machine learning architectures.

[Origin Story]{style="font-weight: 500; color:seagreen;"}: Dr. Manam earned his Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Purdue University, where his research focused on developing NLP methods to detect and resolve ambiguities in crowdsourcing tasks, thereby improving clarity and the quality of results with minimal effort from requesters. He previously served as an AI & NLP Research Scientist at Reveal AI, where he built systems that transformed unstructured data into actionable insights using LLMs and advanced AI techniques.

[Current Quest]{style="font-weight: 500; color:seagreen;"}: Engineering sophisticated data integration strategies that combine multi-modal biological datasets with AI-driven insights. Working to unlock hidden patterns in genomic data that traditional methods miss.

[Hero Tools]{style="font-weight: 500; color:seagreen;"}: Python/R ecosystems, LLMs, and natural language processing pipelines, and advanced AI frameworks.

<!-- ## Doug Welsch - Bioinformatician -->

<!-- He earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science from [William Marsh Rice University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice_University), a leading research university in the United States. During his college years, he also pursued a minor in Biochemistry and Cell Biology. As a student researcher at Rice, he worked in Dr. M. Neal [Waxham's lab](https://sites.google.com/uth.edu/waxham-lab/home) at The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, focusing on image analysis of synthetic lipid vesicles under cryo-EM, and co-authored a publication in [*Biophysical Reports*]{.underline}. He also worked in Dr. [Hongjie Li's Lab](https://www.bcm.edu/people-search/hongjie-li-66406) at Baylor College of Medicine under the supervision of Dr. Tzu-Chiao Lu on single-cell data analysis and published a co-authored paper in [*Science*]{.underline}. -->

<!-- ## Brunno Macedo - PhD student -->

<!-- He received a Bachelor's degree in Biomedical Sciences from the [Federal University of Pernambuco in Brazil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_University_of_Pernambuco), where he gained experience in clinical and laboratory hematology while working as a teacher's assistant for both undergraduate and professional specialization courses for two years. He recently completed a Master of Sciences degree from the [University of São Paulo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_S%C3%A3o_Paulo) at Ribeirão Preto Medical School (Internal Medicine Graduate Program). During his Master's program, he conducted research in [Dr. Fabiola Traina's lab](https://rio.fmrp.usp.br/fabiolatraina/), which focuses on molecular alterations and signaling pathways in myeloid neoplasms. Currently, Brunno is a PhD student at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. -->
