**Principal Investigator**

Dr. Changde Cheng completed his education and training at [Peking University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peking_University), [UCLA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Los_Angeles) (under the guidance of Dr. Charles Taylor), and the [University of Notre Dame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Notre_Dame) (with Dr. [Nora Besansky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nora_J._Besansky)). During his postdoctoral fellowship at the [University of Texas at Austin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Texas_at_Austin) with Dr. [Mark Kirkpatrick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Kirkpatrick), he developed a keen interest in computational genomics and theoretical biology. After that, he worked as a senior/lead computational research scientist at [St. Jude Children's Research Hospital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Jude_Children%27s_Research_Hospital)  before joining the faculty of the Division of Hematology/Oncology at [Heersink School of Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Alabama_at_Birmingham_School_of_Medicine).



<!-- Dr. Changde Cheng completed his undergraduate degree in Genetics and Cell Biology from [Peking University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peking_University), followed by an M.A. in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology from [UCLA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Los_Angeles). He then pursued his Ph.D. from the Department of Biological Sciences at the [University of Notre Dame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Notre_Dame). Afterward, he joined the Center for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics at the [University of Texas at Austin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Texas_at_Austin) as a postdoctoral fellow.
